# A predictive models for the number of canceled hotel reservations using Bayes'a, SVM, XGBOOST, Knn, Random Forest, Decision tree

The data was downloaded from the Kaggle website and contains information about city hotel and resort hotel reservations and information such as the date of reservation, length of stay, number of adults, children and/or infants and number of available parking spaces.
Data comes from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.

In summary, different models perform differently and have different predictive properties. The XGBOOST model achieved the highest accuracy and Kappa value, suggesting that it is the most effective at predicting hotel bookings based on available data. The SVM, RandomForest and kNN models also achieved good results. In contrast, the Naive Bayes model had significantly lower accuracy and Kappa values, suggesting that it is not the best model for these data. Sensitivity and specificity values ​​also vary between models, meaning that different models have different abilities to correctly identify Class 1 and Class 0 cases.
